# RST Assembly Emulation and Testing Framework

This emulation and testing framework has been developed to test assembler code created by students.

It can be integrated into existing CI/CD pipelines or set up from scratch to test code in an automated environment.

The built-in Docker container is ready to use immediately.

This framework is based on the [Unicorn emulation engine](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn).
